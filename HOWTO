How to work with slug.py
========================

*. Configuration

Add your name and email to git configuration:

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

If you have and RW access to PLD repositories please use
<your_login>@pld-linunx.org as email.


*. Get initial copy of repositories

   slug.py clone <package>

It will clone the chosen package to the ~/PLD_clone directory . You can clone more
then one package in one go. For example to get all perl and python packages:

   slug.py clone perl\* python\*

If you are interested in all existing packages:

   slug.py clone

However be afraid that it will take some time to clone all of them. 


* Update all existing repositories

If you have already cloned some repositories and you want to update them:

  slug.py fetch 

It will fetch all branches and will store them in 'origin' remote. You can look
at it as an faster version of executing 'git fetch' for every local repository. 


* Advanced usage

If you want to save some disk space and potentially also some time (for large
repositories like kernel), 'slug.py update' enables to work with only some of
the branches and shallow clones. See

   slug.py update --help

for more details.
